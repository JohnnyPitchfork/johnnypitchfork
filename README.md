# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jonathan Campbell

I'm transitioning from enterprise IT into software development, with a focus on C#, .NET, and automation tooling.  
Currently finishing my AAS in Information Systems & Technology at UVU.

### ðŸ§ª Projects
- [Harry Potter Spellbook App](https://github.com/JohnnyPitchfork/harry-potter-spellbook) â€“ Built in .NET MAUI with a REST API
- Shared Mailbox Manager (WIP) â€“ WPF-based Exchange tool using EOPS and secure JIT session management

### ðŸ’¼ Looking for:
- Entry-level developer roles in C# / .NET
- Infrastructure-aware software teams
- Opportunities to grow through mentorship and hands-on experience

Thanks for visiting â€” this profile is actively being updated as I transition into full-time software engineering.
